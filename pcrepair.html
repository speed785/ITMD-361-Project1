    <h1>Desktop Peripherals</h1>
      <h2>Keyboard</h2>
      <p>Every desktop needs a keyboard and this is an amazing design too! You won't need one unless you have
        a touchscreen screen</p>

      <h2>Desktop Case</h2>
      <p>This is where you can get away with saving money, but it's also where you can have the most fun in the end.</p>

        just stashes the desktop away.
