        I've been to a lot of places in Chicago, constantly looking for new places to take photos to stand out as a
        photographer. I've been North, South, East, West you name it. I'll always be looking and taking more and more
        photos and with Chicago always busy as it is, so will I.

      <li>The best way to stand out is to showcase your work and for me, this is how I do it; with either photos or soon
        to be websites.
